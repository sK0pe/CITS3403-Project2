            | EvilCorp is a multinational conglomerate of a company that sells itself as a saviour to the
            | as possible. Starting off, the company attempted to operate to this ideal, however once publicly
            | floated on the stock exchange, the company was forced to turn to making a profit and nothing else.
        p
            | While pretending to still have lofty goals, the company must privately make as much profit, as
            | efficiently as possible.
        p
            | Your role, as a cog in the EvilCorp machine is to observe the blocks of incoming revenue.  When
            | the opportunity presents itself, if you can line up the revenue in an efficiently sneaky manner
            | it can be stashed in an offshore tax haven as profit that can never be used to improve the quality
            | of the products and services provided by EvilCorp.
        p
            | If you can't stash the revenue it becomes public and must be presented as operating costs.
            | If this revenue overflows the public perception of operating costs, you will be investigated
            | and shut down for fraud.
